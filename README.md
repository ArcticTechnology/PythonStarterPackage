# Python Starter Package
This is a basic python starter package to be used as a template for creating your own python packages. See "PythonStarterPackage Setup Guide.md" in ```doc/``` for a detailed explanation of the package resources.
* Github repo: https://github.com/ArcticTechnology/PythonStarterPackage
* PyPi: https://pypi.org/project/PythonStarterPackage/

## Prerequisites
The Python Starter Package app is intended for the Linux terminal and should work on it out of the box. However, you may need to add ```~/.local/bin/``` to PATH if you are getting a ```command not found``` error when trying to run the app. See this thread for details: https://stackoverflow.com/a/34947489. To add ```~/.local/bin/``` to PATH do the following:
1. Add ```export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH``` to ```~/.bash_profile```.
```
echo export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH > ~/.bash_profile
````
2. Execute command.
```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This app can work for Windows and Mac. It is recommended to run it on the Git Bash terminal. Here are the instructions for installing and setting up Git Bash:

1. Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and click download.
```
Version >= 2.34.1
```
2. During the installation setup, make sure to include OpenSSH. Recommenced setting should be fine:
```
Use bundled OpenSSH - This uses ssh.exe that comes with Git.
```
3. Leave the other settings as default, click through, and install.

IMPORTANT: For Windows, run this app on the ```bash.exe``` terminal rather ```git-bash.exe```. There is a known issue with ```git-bash.exe``` messing up Python ```os``` commands in ```import os```. See this thread for details: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33622087/composer-installation-error-output-is-not-a-tty-input-is-not-a-tty/33623136#33623136.
* ```bash.exe``` can be found in your Git folder in the ```bin/``` directory.
* For example: If ```git-bash.exe``` is here ```C:\Program Files\Git\git-bash.exe``` then you should find ```bash.exe``` here ```C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe```.

## Installation
This library is hosted on PyPi and can be installed via ```pip```:
```
pip3 install PythonStarterPackage
```

## Usage
After installation, you can run this app in your terminal with this command:
```
pythonstarterpackage
```
You can also run it with ```python3 -m```:
```
python3 -m pythonstarterpackage
```
Further, you can import the package resources and run them in your own project:
```
from pythonstarterpackage import *
starter = StarterPkg()
starter.run()
```

## Documentation
The purpose of this project is to show you how to create a standard python package from scratch. This project is inspired by @iamtennislover's excellent getmyip package (https://github.com/iamtennislover/getmyip) and @sigma-coding's great guide on deploying python packages (https://github.com/areed1192/sigma-coding).

### Setup
See "PythonStarterPackage Setup Guide.md" in ```doc/``` for a detailed walkthrough of what each of the package resources do. Once you have an understanding of this package, you can clone this package to your local directory and proceed to testing and deployment.

### Testing
In the directory containing the ```setup.py``` file, you can test the package by installing it in ```pip3``` editable mode. This will allow you make changes to it and test it without having to push the changes each time.
1. Use ```pip3``` to install the package in editable mode:
```
pip3 install -e .
```
2. Run the package by calling the package directly:
```
pythonstarterpackage
```
Or use ```python3 -m```:
```
python3 -m pythonstarterpackage
```
3. Testing the import. Run the ```test_main.py``` file:
```
python3 ./test/test_main.py
```
4. Once finished, delete the PythonStarterPackage.egg-info file and uninstall the package with:
```
pip3 uninstall PythonStarterPackage
```

Note: It is recommended that you use a virtual environment when testing your package.
1. To create a virtual environment:
```
virtualenv venv
```
2. Activate the environment use: ```. venv/bin/activate```. On Windows it may be: ```. venv/Script/activate```.

### Dependency Mapping
Next, make sure to check the package dependencies and update the setup.cfg file as needed. To do this:
1. Create (or overwrite) the requirements.txt document with ```pipreqs```. This is an extremely useful tool because it automatically finds all of the relevant versions of dependencies your package relies on and puts them into the ```requirements.txt``` file. If you don't have ```pipreqs```, install it with ```pip install pipreqs```.
```
pipreqs --force --encoding utf-8
```
2. Once the ```requirements.txt``` is updated, check to see if there is any additional dependencies that need to be added or updated in setup.cfg under the ```install_requires =```. If so, add or update it.

### Deployment
Once the package is ready, we can work on deploying the package.

1. Upgrade ```setuptools```, ```wheel```, and ```twine``` (```twine``` will be used in the next part).
```
pip3 install --upgrade setuptools wheel twine
```
2. Build the package with ```setup.py```.
```
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```
3. Check the contents of the .whl and .tar.gz distributions. The key things to look for are: (1) all of your package subdirectories like utils are added to both distributions, (2) your config and package data are included in both distributions.
```
unzip -l dist/*.whl && tar --list -f dist/*.tar.gz
```
4. Test a local install of the package and run it to make sure it is working.
```
pip3 install .
pythonstarterpackage
```
5. After testing that it is working, uninstall the package from pip3.
```
pip3 uninstall PythonStarterPackage
```
If there are any issues in the above you can always uninstall the package and delete the distributions then proceed to troubleshoot the issue. Once complete start over from the beginning. The commands below allows you to delete the distributions.
```
rm -rf build dist src/*.egg-info
```
BE CAREFUL not to miss copy the above command, as if you delete something you didn't intend you will not be able to retrieve.

### Upload to PyPi
In order to upload to PyPi make sure to setup your PyPi account first. See "PyPi Setup Guide.md" in ```doc/``` for more details. You will also need to have ```twine``` installed and upgraded. Once you have all of this setup do the following:

1. Upload using ```twine```.
```
twine upload dist/*
```
2. Install your package with ```pip```.
```
pip3 install PythonStarterPackage
```
Note: If you get a "Requirements already satisfied..." for PythonStarterPackage when trying to install, it may be because ```pip``` still thinks you have the package already installed from the testing earlier. To cleanly break that connection, simply delete the ```./src/PythonStarterPackage.egg-info```. Then try uninstalling and reinstalling again.

3. Finally, run the app with: ```pythonstarterpackage```.
4. Uninstall with: ```pip3 uninstall PythonStarterPackage```.
